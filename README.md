# DAHENG-VAIMAGING-MER2-CAMERA-DRIVERS-LABWINDOWS
Demo i created for MER2 cameras and labwindows 2012.

Created so that i could test the cameras, and interface them to a larger program. These drivers are based on the visual studio c example given by DAHENG.

Allow theoretically unlimited cameras to be created quickly, simply add one to the struct and initilize. as-is, the program is setup for two cameras.
It would take you a couple of minutes to add or remove a camera, so the software is provided for 2. Tested for both color and mono cameras.

Im not a software engineer. The code works well, atleast for me. I dont care what you do with it, sell it for a million bucks for all i care. No credit ETC.
No Liscence, do whatever.
